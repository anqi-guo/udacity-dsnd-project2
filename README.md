# Project Motivation
This is the second project of Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree program, aiming to practice our skills on using Scikit-learn's `Pipeline`. 
In this project, I trained a model that analyzes the content of the messages sent by people in disasters. 
The model returns the most possible categories of the messages, which will then be directed to appropriate emergent agencies.
